The form had the DELETE method, and this method is not supported by html forms; therefore, 
I changed the DELETE method to POST method, which is recognized by browsers and it also sends 
information securely through the request body instead of the URL (GET method).

The password field was hidden using the class ".hidden-password", so it was not visible but 
still present in the page, so this is not really secure. I fixed by adding "type=pasword", 
that way users can see the password field and their input is marked when typing. I also added 
the "required" attribute to make sure the password field is not empty.

I added validation rules to each field to prevent empty or nonsense data. The username field 
now uses 'required', 'minlength', 'maxlength'. Also, I added 'pattern' so it only accepts letters, 
numbers, and dashes. The password field is now type="password" with required and minlength="8" 
to make it hidden and strong. The age field uses type="number" with limits from 1 to 120 to avoid 
unrealistic values. The email field is type="email" and 'required' to ensure a valid format 
like “name@example.com”. The message field includes 'required' and maxlength="200" 
to keep the text short and meaningful. With these updates, I keep the form safer, cleaner, and also 
more user-friendly.

I have added a 'patern in the email field to check a valid structure and 'maxlength=254' to keep the standard for email addressses. With these improvement I prevent fake, incomplete, or malformed emails and ensure users provide proper email format.

All labels and input names match correctly, so there is no need to change or correct anything here. Labels and input names must match to ensure accurate data submission and proper user accesibility. With the 'for' and 'id' user can focus on the right field, and the name attribute is for the server to recognize values correctly. Placeholders are give users hints about what information they must type in each field; these feature and 'autocomplete' make the form more user friendly.
