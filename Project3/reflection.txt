The form had the DELETE method, and this method is not supported by html forms; therefore, 
I changed the DELETE method to POST method, which is recognized by browsers and it also sends 
information securely through the request body instead of the URL (GET method).

The password field was hidden using the class ".hidden-password", so it was not visible but 
still present in the page, so this is not really secure. I fixed by adding "type=pasword", 
that way users can see the password field and their input is marked when typing. I also added 
the "required" attribute to make sure the password field is not empty.
